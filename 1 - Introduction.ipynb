    "Modern linear algebra is computational, whereas traditional linear algebra is abstract. Modern linear algebra is best learned through code and applications in graphics, statistics, data science, AI, and numerical simulations, whereas traditional linear algebra is learned through proofs and pondering infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Modern linear algebra provides the structural beams that support nearly every algorithm implemented on computers, whereas traditional linear algebra is often intellectual fodder for advanced mathematics university students."
